# OpenSearch protocol 1.1  example

This is an example of a [OpenSearch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch). You can use it for the search in your browser.

![Demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wWHHSWdF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n89wqmafn53ubh1fp6b7.gif)

## Testing

To test the changes locally, you need a secure URL pointing to our localhost environment (aka tunnelling). Feel free to use any tool you know, I can recommend ngrok or localtunnel. You can find other options on this blog post.

### Chrome and Safari

Visit the secure URL on your browser
Refresh the page - the browser has read the link tag and indexed it
Type the URL again and the search shortcut should be available

### Firefox

Firefox requires you to manually index the site as a search engine. The different ways to do it are described in their documentation.
